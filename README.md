# Linear Regression on California Housing Dataset
This project explores the California Housing dataset to predict housing prices using Linear Regression. The goal is to compare multiple models and select the one with the best performance. The project was developed in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
## Features
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and explored the California Housing dataset
- Model Comparison: Tried different models
- Performance Metrics: Evaluated models using RMSE

#  Classification on MNIST Dataset
This project uses the MNIST dataset to classify handwritten digits (0â€“9) by comparing multiple models. The goal was to select the best model based on performance metrics. After testing several classifiers, the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier showed the best results. The project was developed in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
## Featuers
- Data Preprocessing: Loaded and normalized the MNIST dataset for optimal training.
- Model Comparison: Tested various classification models.
- Performance Metrics: Used Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and Grid Search to fine-tune hyperparameters.
## Best Model: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Grid Search was used to find the best parameters for KNN.
- Performance Metrics:
- Precision: Evaluates how many selected items are relevant.
- Recall: Measures how many relevant items are selected.
- F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- Confusion Matrix: Visualizes the true vs. predicted classifications.
